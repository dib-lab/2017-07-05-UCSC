<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
This workshop aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. 
This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. 
Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. 
</p>
<p>
We will cover {{page.day1}}, {{page.day2}}, and {{page.day3}}.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at undergraduate students with no prior computational experience .

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no

        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions

        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

        nano is a basic editor and the default that instructors use in the workshop.
        To install it,
        download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">Software Carpentry Windows installer</a>
        and double click on the file to run it.
        <strong>This installer requires an active internet connection.</strong>
        To check whether nano is installed, open "Git Bash" from the start
        menu, type <code>nano</code> in the new window, and press enter. If the response
        is <code>nano not found</code> or something similar the installer didn't work. Try
        reinstalling or follow the instructions below to use Notepad++ as an
        alternative text editor.
      </p>
      <p>
      To install <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> download
      the installer and install it by clicking on it and following the prompts.
      Then follow these instructions to integrate it with Git Bash:
        <ol>
          <li>Open "Git Bash" from the start menu.</li>
          <li>Type: <code>cd</code> and press enter to make sure you are in
              your home directory.</li>
          <li>Type: <code>notepad .bashrc</code> and press enter. This will
            create <code>.bashrc</code> file in Notepad. Add the following two
              lines of text to the file:
              </br>
              <code>
                export PATH=$PATH:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++" </br>
                alias npp=notepad++
             </code>
         <li>Save the file and exit Notepad.</li>
         <li>Open a new "Git Bash" window. You should now be able to launch
           Notepad++ by typing: <code>npp</code> and pressing enter.</li>
        </ol>
      If you run into trouble please come to the workshop early to get help
      with this.

        Install R by downloading and running
        <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>
        from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.
        Also, please install the
        <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>.
        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as 
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, 
        for example when installing R packages.

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
